This repository contains the code I wrote while I was training, using online tutorials, on Front and Back-End Web Development.

In this Project I created a simple Restful API that POSTS and GETS messages and their details from a database.
The Front-End is and Angular application that communicates with the Restful API making POST requests when a user wants to post a message and GET requests when the user wants to retrieve some of the older messages.

For the Back-End part I used:

- Eclipse with Maven for the project management
- The Spring Framework
- Code written in Java
- Json for transfering Java Objects between my Restful Service and the Database
- Postgresql for my Database

For the Front-End part I used:

- Angular(Coded in Typescript)
- HTML and CSS
- Json for transfering "Message" objects between the Angular app and the Rest API


The repository exists only to showcase the basic knowledge I have in Front and Back-End development.
